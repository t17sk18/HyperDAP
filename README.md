# WFM

To develop an application for O&G company, several teams have been assigned a portion of the workload. WFM was the efforts of my team - Alpha, tasked with the creation of the user interface. The initial design brief was:
• To develop a component that allows users to dynamically create workflows of computational components using a GUI as if they were boxes connected by lines.
• The application will check that the database recorded specification of each selected component allows their connection (i.e. the output if the first component is compatible with the input of the other).
• To use 2D Web graphics (with suitable libraries and frameworks provided) an JavaScript, Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL.
